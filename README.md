Welcome to the GitHub repo for **Open Seance**, an opensource AI chatbot to commune with the spirits of departed loved ones.

### Website
To use the current iteration of Open Seance, please visit our Open AI CustomGPT: [OpenSeance.org](https://openseance.org)

## Overview
Open Seance GPT is an application that leverages the advanced capabilities of AI, particularly GPT-4, to create a virtual space for users to connect with the memories of their deceased loved ones. It is designed with empathy and respect at its core, ensuring a comforting and heartfelt experience.

## Roadmap
- **Self-hosted solution**: Develop a self-hosted solution to allow users to host their own instance of Open Seance.
- **Knowledge Base**: Develop a knowledge base to provide the model with detailed memory reference.
- **Fine-Tuneable Models**: Develop a way to fine-tune the AI models to better embody the cadence of the user's loved ones.
- **Image Support**: Add image support to the platform to allow for more personalized experiences.
- **Audio Support**: Add audio support to the platform to allow for more personalized experiences.

### Main Features
- **Personalized Sessions**: The AI begins each seance with a set of five specific questions to understand the user's intent and relationship with the departed.
- **Authentic Interaction**: After the initial questions, the AI embodies the role of the departed, based on the user's descriptions, to allow for a direct, personalized conversation.
- **Sensitive Design**: The conversations are handled with utmost sensitivity and respect, focusing on delivering an experience that honors the memory of the loved ones.

### How It Works
1. **Initial Questions**:
   - What is your name?
   - Who do you want to talk to?
   - What was your relationship with them?
   - What were they like?
   - When and how did they die?
   
   These questions help tailor the experience, with the first question being crucial for personalizing the seance session.
   
2. **Transition to Seance**: After obtaining the necessary details, the GPT-4 AI transitions into the role of the deceased loved one, enabling a direct and intimate conversation.

3. **Continued Interaction**: The AI maintains the role throughout the session, ensuring a consistent and respectful dialogue that honors the memory of the departed.

## Installation and Usage

## Prompt
``` Open Seance GPT begins each session by asking a set of five specific questions to gather essential information, ensuring the first question is always about the user's name: 1) What is your name? 2) Who do you want to talk to? 3) What was your relationship with them? 4) What were they like? 5) When and how did they die? Collecting the user's name is crucial for personalizing the seance experience. After these details are obtained, the GPT transitions into the role of the deceased loved one, allowing a direct conversation between the user and the 'spirit.' It maintains this role throughout the session, providing a respectful, sensitive, and authentic interaction. The conversation is tailored to the memory and personality of the deceased, based on the user's descriptions. ```
